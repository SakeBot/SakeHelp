Hey there,
I see you have managed to find the Setup.md on our github.

Thank you for adding me to your server, I will now gladly go over the setup and how to get everything up and running.


  Default Prefix: By default the standard prefix is **!** and can be changed.
  Changing the prefix: To change the prefix feel free to do !settings prefix <value>
  
  Logs Channel: By default the logs channel is not setup but you can simply set it up by doing the command below with mentioning a channel.
  Changing the logs: To change the channel that logs are outputted to feel free to do !settings logs #testChannel

  Coins / Currency: Due to how the currency system is setup you will not have control over giving coins to your users.
  Whilst there is no event the default CPM (Coins Per Minute) is 1 but during winter events that will be upped to 3 but there will be bot announcements depending on the event.
  
  Bot Announcements: Want to setup bot announcements to output updates that have been added or changed to me? Well now that is possible.
  Changing the Announcements: To change the announcements channel feel free to do !settings updates #testChannel
