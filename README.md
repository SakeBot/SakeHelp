## The Setup Process
After inviting the bot please be sure to go through the setup process by doing **!setup** and read through it please, Thanks!

## The latest feature update
> Welcoming into the family of updates with 酒 is a Global Voice Channel system

With the time and help from our beta testers we've implemented a feature where you can create and destroy voice channels which hasn't been done anywhere else.\
You want to create a custom voice channel so only you and your friends have access but don't know how to?\
Well with 酒 it's as easy as just typing this **!vc create** and **!vc add @酒。#0001**
> *Tip*: After 5 minutes of the owner not being in the voice channel they created it will automatically delete the channel.


## Some features of 酒
> Global Economics System

An unmodifiable system where you can store your coins and go against other guilds in the leaderboards.

> Limited Yearly Season Events

Last year in the christmas season of 2019 we hosted out first ever winter season to see how everyone would interact with it and it turned out amazing.\
With the success of our first ever global event we are in the middle of planning our next seasonal-event for Easter and we hope that everyone will enjoy it as much as we do right now.

> An in-built support feature

We have included with the bot an in-built way to communicate with our developers and a way to report bugs and submit suggestions.\
To contact our developers directly feel free to just send our bot a **direct message** and we'll respond to it as soon as we can.\
To submit a suggestion feel free to do **!suggest [suggestion]**\
To report a bug feel free to do **!bug [Bug Report]**

## The journey throughout 2019

> Some key events of 2019

- The launch of the bot with great stats

- An amazing first christmas event, here are the stats for it
  - Total Presents Collected: 24,109
  - Total Presents Gifted: 5,224
- The official [site](https://sakebot.xyz) release 


> The start

We had a bumpy start to the project with the JSON storage files corrupting & resetting but thanks to the resolve of our development team we were able to recover and restore lost data and fix the corruption issue which is no longer occuring.

> Half way through the year

We worked hard to get the key feature that would identify this bot out there, A global economics system which **CAN'T** be modified by any guild owners meaning a secure and unmodified system

> Nearing the end

We started work on the christmas event as our first global event yet we weren't aware how much was going to come from this, We also implemented out music system for Premium around this time as well

> The end to 2019

We're finally at the end of 2019, One of the best years so far for this bot.\
We finished up 2019 with more updates than we thought, We'll list two down below:
- A support guild that has independent channels for each person so it's a one-on-one interaction instead of being clustered together and spammed
- Leaderboards for Local guild coins, Global coins and a competitive system against each and every guild using the bot to see who can keep their number one status as the #1 Richest Guild.
